## Thanks to

* @scott-christopher for porting `ListT` and writing the `MonadError`,
  `MonadWriter`, `MonadPlus` and `Alternative` instances for `Proxy`!

## How-To

Have a look at examples to see how to use it. Examples are inspired by http://www.haskellforall.com/2014/02/streaming-logging.html. Follow along that tutorial if you feel like needing a thorough explanation.

Each example is a directory with intructions in corresponding README.
